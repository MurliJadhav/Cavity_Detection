# Cavity_Detection
# Business problem and Introduction:-
In 21 st century 80-90%  peoples are suffered from dental problems and early research shows that the dental problem is related to the cavity. Nowadays peoples are so much busy in their work hence they do not care about themselves this leads to health problems including dental problems. Early diagnosis is very important for maintaining dental problems. Dentists use laser-technology for diagnosis of cavity this is very costly and these results are highly negative that dentists do not rely on results instead they relying on visual inspection. Artificial intelligence helps for identifying dental problems and also it predicts better solutions with the help of dentists to the patients.

Machine learning is the field of artificial intelligence which helps to analyze the function of the brain using an artificial neural network. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. Deep learning is an intelligent technique to work on a huge amount of data for better performance and forecasting.It is used to build an intelligent computer system which can learn complex function mapping the input to output directly from data without depending on human-crafted features
